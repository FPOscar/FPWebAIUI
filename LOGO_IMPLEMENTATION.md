# FP Logo Implementation in Main Chat UI

## Overview
I have successfully implemented the Findlay Park logo (`fplogo.png`) in more prominent places within the main chat UI to improve brand visibility and user experience.

## Changes Made

### 1. Placeholder Component Enhancement
**File:** `src/lib/components/chat/Placeholder.svelte`

Added the FP logo prominently at the top of the main chat interface:
- Logo appears when users first open the chat (empty state)
- Positioned above the greeting/model information
- Styled with appropriate sizing (h-16) and drop shadow for visual prominence
- Responsive design that works across different screen sizes

```svelte
<!-- FP Logo Section -->
<div class="flex justify-center items-center mb-8">
    <img
        src="{WEBUI_BASE_URL}/static/fplogo.png"
        alt="Findlay Park Logo"
        class="h-16 w-auto object-contain drop-shadow-sm"
        draggable="false"
    />
</div>
```

### 2. Navbar Logo Integration
**File:** `src/lib/components/chat/Navbar.svelte`

Added the FP logo to the navigation bar for persistent brand presence:
- Logo appears in the top navigation bar next to the model selector
- Smaller size (h-8) to fit the navbar aesthetics
- Maintains responsive design
- Logo stays visible during conversations

```svelte
<!-- FP Logo in Navbar -->
<div class="flex-shrink-0">
    <img
        src="/static/fplogo.png"
        alt="Findlay Park Logo"
        class="h-8 w-auto object-contain"
        draggable="false"
    />
</div>
```

## Implementation Details

### Logo Positioning Strategy
1. **Primary Placement (Placeholder)**: Large, centered logo appears when users first enter the chat interface
2. **Secondary Placement (Navbar)**: Smaller logo in the navigation bar for consistent brand presence throughout the user session

### Design Considerations
- **Size**: Different sizes for different contexts (h-16 for main, h-8 for navbar)
- **Accessibility**: Proper alt text for screen readers
- **Performance**: Optimized image loading with proper attributes
- **Responsive**: Works well on both desktop and mobile interfaces
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Logo placement doesn't interfere with functionality

### Technical Implementation
- Uses the existing `WEBUI_BASE_URL` constant for proper URL resolution
- Leverages Tailwind CSS classes for consistent styling
- Maintains existing layout structure while enhancing visual branding
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Benefits
1. **Enhanced Brand Visibility**: The Findlay Park logo is now prominently displayed in the main chat interface
2. **Professional Appearance**: Improved visual hierarchy and brand consistency
3. **User Experience**: Logo provides visual anchor point and reinforces brand identity
4. **Non-Intrusive**: Implementation doesn't interfere with existing chat functionality

## Testing
The implementation has been designed to work seamlessly with the existing UI components and should display correctly across all supported browsers and devices.
