# FP Logo Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ Successfully Implemented

I have successfully implemented the Findlay Park logo (`fplogo.png`) in prominent locations within the main chat UI. Here's what was accomplished:

## üéØ Key Changes Made

### 1. **Primary Placement - Chat Placeholder**
- **Location**: `src/lib/components/chat/Placeholder.svelte`
- **Position**: Prominently displayed at the top of the main chat interface
- **Visibility**: Shows when users first open the chat (empty state)
- **Size**: Large format (h-16) for maximum brand impact
- **Styling**: Centered with drop shadow for professional appearance

### 2. **Secondary Placement - Navigation Bar**
- **Location**: `src/lib/components/chat/Navbar.svelte`
- **Position**: Top navigation bar next to model selector
- **Visibility**: Persistent throughout user session
- **Size**: Compact format (h-8) to fit navbar aesthetics
- **Layout**: Responsive design that works on all screen sizes

## üöÄ Implementation Benefits

### Brand Visibility
- **High Impact**: Logo appears immediately when users enter the chat interface

- **Professional Look**: Enhances the overall visual hierarchy and brand identity

### User Experience

## üì± Expected Visual Result
